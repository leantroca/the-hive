The old lighthouse keeper had spent forty years watching the sea, but on his final night before retirement, he witnessed something extraordinary. A pod of dolphins emerged from the moonlit waters, circling the lighthouse in perfect synchrony, their bodies glowing with bioluminescent plankton. He stood mesmerized as they danced beneath the beam, as if performing a farewell just for him. When dawn broke, they were gone, leaving only ripples on the calm surface and a memory that would warm his heart for all the years to come.
